 "Welcome to Our Restaurant" and three sections dedicated to different types of cuisine: Chicken, Beef, and Sushi.

The webpage's design is built with flexibility in mind, as it utilizes a responsive grid layout that adjusts its appearance based on the size of the browser window. This is achieved by utilizing a combination of relative units like percentages and ems, along with CSS media queries to specify breakpoints for different screen sizes.

For example, when the browser window is at least 1200 pixels wide, the restaurant's menu sections will display as three equally wide columns. However, if the browser window is narrower than 1200 pixels, the sections will automatically reorganize into two equally wide columns, with the third section occupying the full width of the page. Finally, when the browser window is narrower than 800 pixels, each section will take up the full width of the page, effectively stacking them vertically.

Additionally, the CSS code also includes styling for the sections' headings, such as font size, color, and positioning relative to the content. The CSS media queries allow for customized styling for different screen sizes, as demonstrated by the different background colors for the section headings.

Overall, this responsive webpage demonstrates the practical application of modern web design techniques, ensuring a visually appealing and user-friendly experience for viewers regardless of their device's screen size.</s>
